4 vms are spun up to run two app servers, two database (1 master & 1 slave) for redundancy, 1 load balancer (nginx also reverse proxy) & 1 monitoring server (having ganglia agent). All the machines were created by Oracle VM box hypervisor & vagrant.

Below are the host names, configurations & software installed.
1) lb01 : Acts as load balancer, reverse proxy, ansible control server & nginx log parser. 
   a) nginx configuration files are in /etc/nginx/ directory. (nginx.conf & conf.d/defaults.conf files)
   b) cached responses are stored in /home/vagrant/nginxcache
   c) nginx log files are sored in /var/log/nginx/ directory. (both access.log & error.log)
   d) ansible configurations are stored in /home/vagrant/ansible directory (ansible.cfg, inventory & playbooks)
   e) Finally lb01 has goaccess software to parse nginx logs and pretty present the logs as mentioned in section 4
      command to run is : sudo goaccess -f /var/log/nginx/access.log
   
2) app01 : Acts as an application server & slave mysql database
   a) app codebase in app/springboot-demo-app directory and java -jar target/entries-1.0.0.jar will run the java process
   b) env variables containing are permanently stored and could be viewed by printenv command
      export APP_DATABASE_USER=slave_user
      export APP_DATABASE_PASSWORD=ItsComplexPas1word!
      export APP_DATABASE_URL='jdbc:mysql://192.168.135.121:3306/deposit_solutions?autoReconnect=true'
      export APP_DATABASE_SCHEMA=none
      export APP_FLYWAY_ENABLED=false
      export MAVEN_OPTS="-Xms512m -Xmx1024m" 
 Â  c) It acts as a slave mysql database as well. Run show slave status\G; command to check the replication status. Slave configuration present in /etc/mysql/my.cnf file
 
 3) db01 : Acts as a mysql database server & application server
    a) Acts as MySQL master database. Run show master status\G; to check the master status. Master configuration present in /etc/mysql/my.cnf file.
    b) Application configuration is same as app01 including env variables
    c) Database replicated is deposit_solutions and it has entries table which is created by flyway schema migration.
    
 4) m01 : Acts as a montoring server. Ganglia is the opensource montioring tool.
    a) Ganglia configurations are in /etc/ganglia directory. gmetad.conf & gmond.conf are the configuration files
    b) gmetad.conf file has server related metadata & gmond.conf has client related configuration to monitor ganglia server
    c) All ganglia clients db01, app01 & lb01 nodes have gmond process which ingest data to m01 and they are part of "Deposit Solution Cluster" available at http://94.130.52.98:8090/ganglia webpage.  The webpage has both cluster & server wise metric details.
